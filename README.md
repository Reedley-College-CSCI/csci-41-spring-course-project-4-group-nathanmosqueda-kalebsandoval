1) How and where are you meeting the requirements for this particular requirements? For example, for the search/sort project, you would write in which class(es) you implemented a search and sort and what algorithms have been implemented. How are you reporting the complexity and again which class(es) (should hopefully be the same class where your sort and search is/are implemented). 

We are meeting the requirements for project 4 by one replacing the system of arrays that we had previously with linked lists that are able to be traversed foward and backward, in addition we kept in things required that were already in the code. Such as a method to search in the list and the addition and removal of items through the program. And of course the time complexities are reported as well.

3) What changes did you implement to address feedback from the previous project. You are being given a grade for continuous improvement based on previous feedback. Indicate what changes you made and in which class(es) these changes can be found.

In terms of changes made based on previous feedback from the professor. the main thing is just adjusting the sorting algorithm. The amount of options for sorting at the end of the day werent too useful so we cut back on it to what was really nessecary.
